# Architecture discipline: one canonical owner per decision

APM is a pipeline of durable facts (targets, lock state, install
outcomes, compiled output, hook shapes, credentials, deployment
provenance). Most reliability bugs in this codebase have one shape:
the SAME decision was computed or enforced in more than one place, so
a fix on one path silently missed a sibling path. The cure is
structural, not case-by-case.

## The rule

Every durable decision, vocabulary, outcome, write, or contract has
exactly ONE canonical owner. Every call site routes THROUGH that owner
instead of re-deriving the answer locally.

- A "decision" is anything a reader must be able to trust is computed
  identically everywhere: the accepted target set, whether an install
  succeeded, the on-disk shape of a hook, the integrity hash of a
  deployed file, the resolved credential for a host.
- Adding a second place that computes or enforces the same decision is
  a "split authority" and is a defect even if it currently agrees --
  it WILL drift the next time one side is patched.

## Existing canonical owners -- route through these, do not re-derive

The `Owner path selectors` column is executable contract data. The
shepherd-driver owner-touch gate parses it directly; do not copy these
selectors into another table or script. Keep selectors repository-relative,
semicolon-delimited, and specific to the file(s) that own the fact.

<!-- /canonical-owner-table -->

Host + credential resolution includes public github.com anonymous-first ordering.
Consumers must ask `AuthResolver` rather than reclassifying that host locally.

If you are about to compute one of these locally, stop and call the
owner. If the owner is missing a case you need, EXTEND the owner --
never fork it.

## When you centralize or fix a split-authority bug: dual guardrail

A fix is not done until the split cannot silently return. Add BOTH:

1. A behavioral **regression test** (hermetic, under tests/) that
   encodes the exact symptom and fails before / passes after.
2. A **static boundary guard** so a future contributor cannot re-add a
   second owner: extend scripts/lint-architecture-boundaries.sh and the
   matching tests/integration/test_architecture_*.py suite.

The scripts/lint-architecture-boundaries.sh check is wired into CI (the
Lint job) alongside the auth-signal guard. Treat a new authority the
same way: give it a guard line.

Static boundary checks use bounded AST inspection and do not trace alias
dataflow such as `view = lock.field; view.clear()`. Behavioral regression
tests and code review remain the guard for those indirect mutations.

## Review lens

When reviewing or authoring a change, ask: "Does this compute or
enforce a decision the codebase already owns elsewhere?" If yes, the
change must route through the owner, and a new parallel path is a
blocking finding, not a nit.
