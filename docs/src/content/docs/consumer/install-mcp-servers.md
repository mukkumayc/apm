`apm install` is the same driver for two artifact kinds: APM packages
(see [Install Packages](../install-packages/)) and MCP servers. This
page covers MCP servers: how you declare them, what gets written to
each runtime, and how tokens get injected.

## One-line answer

```bash
apm install --mcp io.github.github/github-mcp-server
```

This adds one entry under `dependencies.mcp:` in `apm.yml`. APM then attempts
runtime-specific MCP config writes for targets that pass selection, scope, and
adapter prerequisites.

## The `mcp:` section in apm.yml

The two sections have different propagation rules. In the root project,
`apm install` activates both sections for the author's environment. A
direct or transitive dependency package contributes only
`dependencies.mcp`; its `devDependencies.mcp` entries never enter the
consumer's target config, lockfile provenance, or audit baseline.
This keeps package-author debug servers out of consumer tool lists.

MCP servers live under `dependencies.mcp:` (or
`devDependencies.mcp:`). Three forms are valid -- pick the one that
matches the source you have:

```yaml
dependencies:
  mcp:
    # 1. Registry reference (bare string)
    - io.github.github/github-mcp-server

    # 2. Self-defined stdio (local process)
    - name: filesystem
      registry: false
      transport: stdio
      command: npx
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/workspace"]

    # 3. Self-defined remote (HTTP / SSE)
    - name: linear
      registry: false
      transport: http
      url: https://mcp.linear.app/sse
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer ${LINEAR_TOKEN}"

    # 4. Self-defined remote with harness-specific extra keys
    - name: slack
      registry: false
      transport: http
      url: https://mcp.slack.com/mcp
      oauth:
        clientId: "<pre-registered-client-id>"
        callbackPort: 3118
```

Unknown keys like `oauth` above are **passthrough fields**: they are
preserved and written into the generated config for every harness you
install (so a Claude Code `oauth` block reaches all targets; harnesses
that do not recognise it ignore it). Keys that collide with a modeled
field (`command`, `url`, `headers`, `env`, ...) are rejected with a
warning so they cannot redirect a server. See
[Manifest Schema](../../reference/manifest-schema/) for the full rules.

The full grammar (overlays, `${input:...}` variables, `tools:`
allowlists, `package:` selection) is in
[Package Anatomy](../../concepts/package-anatomy/).

## Adding a server from the CLI

`apm install --mcp NAME` writes the entry into `apm.yml` for you,
then runs install. Three shapes match the three manifest forms:

```bash
# Registry
apm install --mcp io.github.github/github-mcp-server

# stdio (everything after `--` is the spawn command)
apm install --mcp filesystem -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /workspace

# Remote
apm install --mcp linear --transport http --url https://mcp.linear.app/sse
```

`apm mcp install NAME ...` is an alias that forwards to the same code
path. The `apm mcp` group also provides `search`, `list`, and `show`
for discovery -- see the [CLI reference](../../reference/cli/install/).

## What `apm install` writes to disk

For every selected target that passes its scope and adapter prerequisites,
`apm install` writes a runtime-specific MCP config file. The schemas differ;
the `apm.yml` source of truth does not.

Registry-declared environment variables honor the registry's
`required` flag. Servers with optional auth install without token
prompts until you choose to configure one. See the
[manifest schema reference](../../reference/manifest-schema/#424-variable-references-in-headers-and-env)
for the full required-vs-optional runtime config rule.

MCP Registry v0.1 container packages use `registryType: oci`. APM
selects Docker automatically, keeps Docker run options before the image,
and places package arguments after the image. Copilot, Codex, Gemini,
and related adapters prefer packages in `npm`, OCI, then PyPI order.
VS Code prefers `npm`, PyPI, then OCI. OCI packages require Docker to be
available when the harness starts the server; no per-target launcher
configuration is needed.

When a required registry runtime variable has a default, APM prompts once
per variable and displays that default as the suggested answer. Press Enter
to accept it or provide an override. Secret defaults remain accepted on
Enter but are never displayed. For OCI/Docker launchers, non-secret selected
values replace every `{variable}` reference across the package's runtime and
package arguments before the native config is written. VS Code renders secret
variables as target-native secret-input references instead, so secret bytes
never enter `mcp.json`. A required variable without a collected value or
default declines that target configuration; VS Code treats `workspaceFolder`
as its built-in `${workspaceFolder}` token.

For VS Code and Copilot-family adapters, non-container `npm`, `pypi`,
and generic packages preserve typed v0.1 `runtimeArguments` and
`packageArguments` in authored order, with exactly one semantic package
identity. Legacy `value_hint` arguments remain supported. Registry
defaults resolve normally, secret variables use target-native references,
unresolved optional groups are omitted atomically, and malformed or
unresolved required entries fail closed.

## How `targets:` gates which configs get written

MCP install resolves targets in this order:

1. Explicit CLI selection: `--runtime` (legacy, one runtime) or `--target`
   (one or more targets).
2. Canonical `targets:` / `target:` values declared in `apm.yml`.
3. The saved `apm config set target ...` default.
4. Machine discovery, only when the manifest and saved config do not
   restrict targets.

`--exclude` narrows whichever set wins. Progress output names that
post-exclusion selection; project, scope, and adapter gates can still skip a
write.

The same effective decision drives package, MCP, and LSP phases; APM does
not re-resolve each phase independently.

At project scope, the `copilot` target writes MCP state to
`.github/mcp.json`, which Copilot CLI discovers from the repository. The
`vscode` target writes only `.vscode/mcp.json`. At global scope, `copilot`
writes `$COPILOT_HOME/mcp-config.json`, or `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` when
`COPILOT_HOME` is unset.

**Portability boundary:** A committed target list makes lockfile MCP ownership
deterministic across machines with different installed harnesses. If `targets:`
is omitted (or a legacy `all` declaration is folded to omission), machine
discovery is intentional and ownership can follow each machine's installed
harnesses. Declare targets when teammates or CI must produce the same MCP
ownership.

When a runtime is outside the active target set, APM does NOT write
its MCP config -- and announces the drop on stdout so you can confirm
the gate took effect:

```text
[i] Skipped MCP config for claude, codex  (active targets: copilot)
```

On reinstall, removing a previously configured target also removes the
APM-managed server entries from that target's native config. User-authored
servers and unrelated JSON or TOML settings remain unchanged.

This single rule replaces two older ones that used to coexist:

- A "directory opt-in" carve-out for Cursor / Gemini / OpenCode -- now
  redundant, because `targets:` (or auto-detection) drives the gate
  for those runtimes too.
- The pre-#1335 silent skip path, which dropped non-listed runtimes
  without telling you.

A malformed `targets:` field (both `target:` and `targets:` set,
`targets: []`, or an unknown target name) fails closed before machine discovery:
no MCP files are written and an `[x]` error names the field to fix. A greenfield
project with no `targets:`, no `--target` flag, no saved target, AND no detected
signals (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.cursor/`, etc.) also fails closed
with the same `[x]` voice -- consistent with how `apm install` treats the same
input. The command exits non-zero before adding a direct `--mcp` entry to
`apm.yml` or deploying package files. Pin a target with `--target`, declare one
in `apm.yml`, or save one with `apm config set target <value>`. A native MCP
config write failure also exits non-zero and names the target path or
permissions to check. (#1335)

`apm install -g --mcp NAME` routes the write to each runtime's
user-scope MCP config (for example, Copilot CLI to
`$COPILOT_HOME/mcp-config.json` when `COPILOT_HOME` is set, otherwise
`~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`; Claude Code to
`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.claude.json` when `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set to a
non-whitespace absolute path. Unset or blank values use `~/.claude.json`;
relative values are rejected. Codex CLI writes to
`$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` when `CODEX_HOME` is set to a non-whitespace value or `~/.codex/config.toml` otherwise, Gemini CLI to `~/.gemini/settings.json`, Antigravity CLI to `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`, Windsurf to
`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`, Kiro to `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`,
and JetBrains Copilot to its OS-specific user config). When the
package declares a `targets:` field (or the CLI passes `--target`),
only the matching runtimes receive the config write. When neither
restricts targets, all detected user-scope-capable runtimes are
configured. Workspace-only runtimes (VS Code, Cursor, OpenCode) are
skipped at user scope. The direct command reads and updates
`~/.apm/apm.yml`; it does not fall back to the current project's manifest.

## stdio vs HTTP servers

MCP defines two transport families. APM exposes both:

- **stdio** -- APM (and your harness) spawns a local process and
  speaks MCP over its stdio. Requires `command:` and optional
  `args:`. Use `--env KEY=VALUE` (repeatable) for environment
  variables. Servers do not go through a shell, so `$VAR` and
  backticks in `args` are passed literally.
- **http / sse / streamable-http** -- APM points your harness at a
  remote endpoint. Requires `url:` (http or https only -- websockets
  and `file://` are rejected). Use `--header KEY=VALUE` (repeatable)
  for HTTP headers such as `Authorization`.

Codex requires HTTPS for non-loopback remote endpoints. Plain HTTP is
accepted only for literal loopback addresses such as `localhost`,
`ip6-localhost`, `127.0.0.0/8`, and `::1`, which keeps local development
servers usable without sending cleartext traffic off the machine. For example:

```sh
apm install --target codex --mcp local-dev --url http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

This writes the endpoint to the Codex MCP configuration.

`--transport` is inferred when omitted: a `--url` implies a remote
transport, a post-`--` command implies `stdio`. The mutually-exclusive
combinations (`--url` plus stdio command, `--header` without `--url`,
etc.) are rejected with exit code 2.

## Token injection: GitHub MCP server

APM does not template arbitrary environment variables into MCP config
files (your harness does that at runtime). It does inject one
specific credential automatically:

When the Copilot CLI adapter writes a remote MCP config and the
server is identified as the GitHub MCP server, APM resolves a token
and adds an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

The server is identified as "GitHub" only when it satisfies **both** of
these narrow checks
([copilot.py:1004](https://github.com/microsoft/apm/blob/main/src/apm_cli/adapters/client/copilot.py#L1004)):

1. The server name (case-insensitive) is one of:
   `github-mcp-server`, `github`, `github-mcp`,
   `github-copilot-mcp-server`.
2. **And** the parsed URL hostname matches the GitHub host allowlist
   (`github.com`, `*.github.com`, `githubcopilot.com` hosts, and
   registered GHES hostnames).

This is a parsed-host allowlist on hostname, not a substring check.
A URL like `https://github.com.evil.example` does not match because
the parsed hostname is `github.com.evil.example`, not `github.com`.

The token is resolved from this chain (first non-empty wins):

1. `GITHUB_COPILOT_PAT`
2. `GITHUB_TOKEN`
3. `GITHUB_APM_PAT`
4. `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (Copilot CLI compat)

If none are set, no header is injected and the server is written
without auth -- you will get an unauthenticated request at runtime.
For other authenticated remote servers, set headers explicitly with
`--header Authorization="Bearer ${MY_TOKEN}"`.

## Updating and replacing a server

Re-run `apm install --mcp NAME ...` against an existing entry:

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| New `NAME` | Appended to `dependencies.mcp`. |
| Existing `NAME`, identical config | No-op. Logs `unchanged`. |
| Existing `NAME`, different config, TTY | Prompts to replace. |
| Existing `NAME`, different config, CI | Refuses with exit 2. Re-run with `--force`. |

Use `--dry-run` to preview the manifest change without writing.

## Sibling commands

The `apm mcp` group is for discovery and standalone install:

```
apm mcp search <query>    # search the configured registry
apm mcp list              # list available servers
apm mcp show <name>       # detailed server info
apm mcp install <name>    # alias for `apm install --mcp <name>`
```
