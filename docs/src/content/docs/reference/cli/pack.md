## Synopsis

```bash
apm pack [OPTIONS]
```

## Description

`apm pack` produces distributable artifacts from the current APM project. It reads `apm.yml` to decide what to emit:

- `dependencies:` mapping present -> a bundle (directory by default, or archive with `--archive`; see `--archive-format`). An explicit empty mapping (`dependencies: {}`) produces a bundle of the package's local content; an omitted or null `dependencies:` value does not.
- `marketplace:` block present -> selected marketplace artifacts.
- `target:` (or `targets:`) field containing `claude` or `copilot` -> ecosystem-specific `plugin.json` files.
- Both blocks present -> bundle plus selected marketplace artifacts in a single run.

The bundle is built from `apm.lock.yaml`. An enriched copy of the lockfile (per-file SHA-256 in `bundle_files`, plus `pack:` metadata) is embedded inside the bundle so `apm install <bundle>` can verify integrity at install time.

Bundles are target-agnostic. The consumer's project decides where files land at install time -- the bundle carries no harness binding. Flags whose scope does not match the detected outputs are silent no-ops, not errors, so the same `apm pack` invocation works in CI across projects that produce only a bundle, only a marketplace, or both.

## Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--claude-plugin` | on (no-flag default) | Select the Claude Code plugin bundle: `plugin.json` plus plugin-native subdirs (`agents/`, `skills/`, `commands/`, `instructions/`, `hooks/`). This is what `apm pack` produces with zero flags. |
| `--format plugin\|agent-plugin\|claude\|claude-plugin\|apm` | `claude-plugin` | Bundle format selector. `agent-plugin` is the sole opt-in for the portable Agent Plugins v1 bundle. `plugin` is a compatibility alias for the Claude Code plugin bundle, not for `agent-plugin`. `claude` and `claude-plugin` also select the Claude Code plugin bundle (the no-flag default). `apm` emits the legacy APM bundle layout, kept for tooling that still consumes it (e.g. `microsoft/apm-action@v1` restore mode). Passing more than one selector (`--claude-plugin`, `--format`) is a usage error. |
| `--archive` | off | Produce a `.zip` archive instead of a directory (previous default: `.tar.gz`; use `--archive-format tar.gz` for legacy CI pipelines). Bundle only. |
| `--archive-format zip\|tar.gz` | `zip` | Archive format when `--archive` is set. `zip` is natively extractable on Windows and matches the format expected by Claude Code and plugin hosts. `tar.gz` is typically smaller for text-heavy bundles and preserves the previous default for pipelines that depend on it. |
| `-o`, `--output PATH` | `./build` | Bundle output directory. Does not affect the `marketplace.json` path. |
| `--force` | off | Allow overwriting on collision. In `plugin` bundle format, last writer wins instead of first; for generated `plugin.json` manifests, overwrites an existing file instead of preserving it. |
| `--dry-run` | off | Print what would be packed without writing anything. |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | off | Show per-file paths and detailed packer output. |
| `--offline` | off | Marketplace: resolve version ranges from cached refs only; skip `git ls-remote`. |
| `--include-prerelease` | off | Marketplace: allow pre-release tags to satisfy version ranges. |
| `-m`, `--marketplace FORMATS` | all configured | Comma-separated list of marketplace formats to build. Sentinels: `all` (every configured format), `none` (skip marketplace entirely). |
| `--marketplace-path FORMAT=PATH` | manifest default | Override the output path for a specific format. Repeatable. Example: `--marketplace-path codex=./dist/codex.json`. |
| `--json` | off | Emit machine-readable JSON to stdout. All logs move to stderr. Shape: `{ok, dry_run, warnings, errors, metadata_enrichment: {certifiable, outcomes: [...]}, marketplace: {outputs: [...]}}`. |
| `--legacy-skill-paths` | off | Bundle skills under per-client paths (e.g. `.cursor/skills/`) instead of the converged `.agents/skills/`. Compatibility flag. |
| `--check-versions` | off | Release gate: verify per-package versions agree with the configured `marketplace.versioning.strategy` (`lockstep`, `tag_pattern`, or `per_package`). Exits `3` on misalignment. Composes with `--check-clean` and `--dry-run`. |
| `--check-clean` | off | Release gate: regenerate every configured marketplace output to a temp representation and diff against the same effective path used by `apm pack`, including `--marketplace-path` overrides. Exits `4` for drift or for remote Claude metadata that can't be fetched to certify the regeneration. Combine with `--dry-run` to compare without normal pack output generation. |
| `--strict-metadata` | off | Claude marketplace: fail before writing when remote package metadata cannot be fetched. Use it in publishing CI to require those fetches to succeed. Exits `5`. |
| `--target`, `-t VALUE` | auto-detect | **Deprecated.** Recorded as informational `pack.target` metadata only; ignored by `apm install`. Will be removed in a future release. |

:::caution[Migrating automation from `.tar.gz`?]
`apm pack --archive` now produces `.zip`. If your CI release, checksum, or
upload step still matches `build/*.tar.gz`, add `--archive-format tar.gz` or
update the downstream glob to `.zip`.

## Examples

### Bundle only

```bash
apm pack                              # Claude plugin bundle (default), ./build/
apm pack --archive                    # Claude plugin bundle as .zip (default)
apm pack --archive --archive-format tar.gz  # legacy CI: produce .tar.gz instead
apm pack --format agent-plugin        # explicit Agent Plugin v1 bundle
apm pack --format apm -o ./dist       # legacy APM bundle layout
```

### Marketplace only

```bash
apm pack
apm pack --offline --dry-run

# Build only Claude format, output as JSON for CI:
apm pack --marketplace=claude --json

# Override codex output path:
apm pack --marketplace-path codex=./dist/codex-marketplace.json

# Build all formats, preview paths:
apm pack --marketplace=all --json | jq -r '.marketplace.outputs[].path'
```

### Both artifacts in one run

```bash
apm pack
apm pack --archive --offline
```

### Configure marketplace output paths

```yaml
marketplace:
  outputs:
    claude: {}
    codex:
      path: ./build/codex-marketplace.json
```

### Preview without writing

```bash
apm pack --dry-run
apm pack --archive --dry-run -v
```

## Output format

### Claude plugin bundle (`--claude-plugin`, default)

A Claude Code plugin directory under `--output`. Contains:

- `plugin.json` -- schema-conformant manifest. Convention-dir keys are stripped because Claude Code auto-discovers them.
- Plugin-native subdirs populated from local source and installed dependencies: `agents/`, `skills/`, `commands/`, `instructions/`, `hooks/`, `extensions/` (canvas extensions, when the `canvas` experimental flag is enabled).
  - When `.apm/` exists, local primitives and hooks are sourced from `.apm/`. Root convention sources are skipped with actionable warnings.
  - Without `.apm/`, supported plugin-native root directories remain pack sources, including after `apm init` writes [`includes: auto`](../../manifest-schema/#39-includes).
  - An explicit `includes:` list is exhaustive. A missing or unpackable listed path stops packing instead of falling back to implicit discovery.
- Installed dependencies are packed exclusively from lockfile-attested `deployed_files`; the `apm_modules` cache is never packed (it has no provenance or integrity guarantee). Each attested file is verified against its `deployed_file_hashes` SHA-256 before inclusion.
  - If the dependency declares `skills:`, only the named skills are included; the cache cannot add extras.
  - If a dependency has cached primitives but no `deployed_files`, `apm pack` fails and tells you to run `apm install`.
- A merged `hooks.json` from the producer's own hooks. Dependency hook-configs and MCP-configs are not merged into the bundle; dependencies contribute only their attested `deployed_files` (hook scripts recorded there still map into `hooks/`).
- `apm.lock.yaml` -- enriched copy with `pack:` metadata and a `bundle_files` map of per-file SHA-256 digests, used by `apm install` for install-time integrity verification.
- `devDependencies` are excluded.

### Agent Plugin bundle (`--format agent-plugin`)

An explicit opt-in. `apm pack --format agent-plugin` emits a strict, portable [Agent Plugins v1](https://agent-plugins.org) bundle instead of the Claude-compatible layout above. `--format plugin` does **not** select this bundle -- it is a compatibility alias for the Claude plugin bundle below.

- `plugin.json` -- identifies the pinned Agent Plugins v1 schema (`$schema: "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json"`), synthesised from `apm.yml` the same way as the Claude plugin manifest.
- `skills/` -- standard skill bundles. This is the **only** primitive directory the Agent Plugin bundle carries.
- `mcp.json` -- MCP server declarations from `apm.yml`/`apm.lock.yaml` (present even when empty).
- `apm.lock.yaml`, and `README.md`/`LICENSE`/`CHANGELOG.md` when present at the project root.

The portable schema deliberately scopes to `skills/` and MCP config so a bundle can be consumed by any Agent-Plugin-aware host, not just APM. Agents, commands, instructions, extensions, hooks, and LSP configuration stay in the Claude-compatible layout instead. If your source project has any of them, `apm pack --format agent-plugin` **fails before writing anything**:

```text
Cannot pack Agent Plugin: non-portable primitives would be discarded (agents, hooks).
Agent Plugins v1 portable components are limited to root plugin.json, skills/, and
root mcp.json. Use 'apm pack --format claude-plugin' to preserve agents, hooks in the
legacy Claude client format.
```

LSP configuration gets its own guidance in the same error, since neither bundle format carries it: configure LSP servers directly in the target client instead.

:::note[Planned]
`apm install` does not yet deploy Agent Plugin bundles or packages -- installing one fails closed with an explicit message today, pending native Agent Plugins runtime integration. Use `--format agent-plugin` to produce a portable artifact for external Agent-Plugin-aware hosts; use the default Claude plugin bundle (or `--format apm`) for anything you need `apm install` to deploy right now.
:::

### APM bundle (`--format apm`)

The legacy APM layout under `--output`. Files are copied preserving their install-time directory structure. Installed dependencies are packed exclusively from lockfile-attested `deployed_files`, and each file is verified against its `deployed_file_hashes` SHA-256 before it is copied (the same integrity gate the Claude plugin format applies) -- a file whose bytes no longer match its recorded hash fails the pack with `... does not match the hash recorded in apm.lock.yaml`. Files with no recorded hash (older lockfiles) pack without verification. The bundle's `apm.lock.yaml` carries the same `pack:` metadata and `bundle_files` digests. The project's own `apm.lock.yaml` is never modified.

Example enriched lockfile fragment:

```yaml
pack:
  format: apm
  packed_at: '2026-03-09T12:00:00+00:00'
  bundle_files:
    .github/agents/architect.md: a1b2c3...
lockfile_version: '1'
generated_at: ...
dependencies:
  - repo_url: owner/repo
```

### Marketplace artifacts

`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` by default, plus any additional artifact selected by `marketplace.outputs` such as `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` for Codex. Each remote plugin's version range is resolved against `git ls-remote`; local-path entries pass through verbatim. Files are written atomically, and parent directories are created if absent.

Configure marketplace artifact paths in `apm.yml` with the `marketplace.outputs` map, keyed by format. Use `--marketplace-path FORMAT=PATH` to override per-format output paths at pack time.

Remote Claude entries can inherit `description` and `version` from their own
`apm.yml`. If APM cannot fetch that metadata, normal packing writes the artifact
with an actionable warning so authors can add those fields to the marketplace
entry or retry with network access. Use `--strict-metadata` in publishing CI to
fail before writing with uncertifiable remote metadata. `--check-clean` also fails with exit
`4` rather than certifying a regeneration whose metadata could not be fetched.

### Plugin manifests

Ship one APM package; consumers get a native plugin for their tool of choice. When `apm.yml` declares a [`target:`](../../manifest-schema/#36-target) (or `targets:`) field containing `claude` or `copilot`, `apm pack` generates an ecosystem-specific `plugin.json` so the same source tree drops into a Claude Code plugin directory or a Copilot plugin path with no hand-editing.

| Ecosystem | Output path |
|---|---|
| `claude` | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` |
| `copilot` | `.github/plugin/plugin.json` |

This runs for the default Claude plugin build (`--claude-plugin`, or `--format plugin|claude|claude-plugin`, since `plugin` is a compatibility alias for the Claude plugin bundle). Under an
explicit `--format agent-plugin` build, the Claude ecosystem
manifest is skipped -- if `target:` names only `claude` and the project has no
other agent sources, `apm pack --format agent-plugin` fails and tells you to use
`apm pack --claude-plugin` instead.

Add one line to `apm.yml` and pack:

```yaml
# apm.yml
name: my-plugin
version: 1.0.0
target: claude
```

```bash
apm pack   # writes .claude-plugin/plugin.json
```

Use `targets: [claude, copilot]` instead to emit both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.github/plugin/plugin.json` from the one source tree in a single `apm pack`.

`target:` and `targets:` are mutually exclusive: declaring both is a build error (exit `1`). An empty `targets:` list or an unrecognised ecosystem token is likewise rejected before any artifact is written.

The manifest is synthesised from `apm.yml` identity fields (`name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`). Per-ecosystem differences:

- **Claude:** includes `mcpServers` sourced from `.mcp.json` when that file declares servers that survive credential stripping.
- **Copilot:** omits `mcpServers`.

#### Credential stripping (Claude `mcpServers`)

`.mcp.json` routinely embeds secrets that an MCP host injects at startup, so they are removed before the manifest is written -- a committed `plugin.json` never leaks them. Stripping is recursive and applies at any nesting depth:

- Credential-bearing keys are dropped: `env`/`environment`/`headers`/`authorization` blocks, plus any key whose name contains `token`, `secret`, `password`, `credential`, `apikey`, or `key`.
- Secret-shaped values are redacted even when the key name is innocuous: `user:pass@host` URL userinfo, inline `--token=...` flags, space-separated `--token value` pairs, shell `ENV=secret` prefixes, `Bearer`/`Basic` auth headers, and bare provider tokens (GitHub, OpenAI, Slack, AWS, Google, GitLab, npm, PyPI, HuggingFace, Stripe, SendGrid, Supabase, Databricks, and other recognised provider token prefixes) passed as positional `args`.

A warning lists everything dropped or redacted, led by the consequence (secrets withheld from commit).

#### Overwrite and dry-run

If a `plugin.json` already exists at the target path it is **preserved**: `apm pack` warns and skips the write. Re-run with `--force` to overwrite it (the same flag that governs bundle collisions). The `--dry-run` flag prevents any writes -- the manifest content is computed but not persisted.

:::note[Planned]
The generated manifest is intentionally minimal. Enrichment fields (`homepage`, `repository`, `keywords`, `author.url`) are planned for a follow-up release ([#1621](https://github.com/microsoft/apm/issues/1621)).
:::

Plugin manifest generation runs after BUNDLE and MARKETPLACE phases so the generated file is never accidentally included in the bundle export.

## Behavior

- **Lockfile-attested dependencies.** Dependency content is packed exclusively from lockfile `deployed_files` and verified against `deployed_file_hashes`; the `apm_modules` cache is never packed. If a dependency has cached primitives but no `deployed_files`, `apm pack` errors and tells you to run `apm install`.
- **Hidden-character scan.** Source files are scanned before bundling. Findings are reported as warnings only -- packing is non-blocking. Consumers are protected at install time, where critical findings block.
- **Empty bundle warning.** If no package files match after dependency resolution, `apm pack` emits a warning and exits `0` with an empty bundle. Missing dependency content is an error, not an empty bundle.
- **Share line.** On success, `apm pack` prints `Share with: apm install <bundle-path>` so the produced bundle is immediately copy-pasteable.
- **Marketplace fallback.** With no `marketplace:` block in `apm.yml`, a legacy `marketplace.yml` file is read with a deprecation warning. Both files present is a hard error.
- **Marketplace outputs.** Configure via `marketplace.outputs` map (keyed by format). Claude is included by default. The legacy list form (`outputs: [claude]`) still parses with a deprecation warning. Use `--marketplace=` to filter which formats are built in a given invocation.
- **JSON mode.** `--json` makes `apm pack` machine-friendly: stdout is a single JSON object, all human-readable logs move to stderr. Combine with `--marketplace=` for selective CI matrix builds.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success. Requested artifacts written (or, with `--dry-run`, planned). |
| `1` | Build or runtime error: network failure, ref not found, no tag matches a marketplace range, lockfile read error, or unhandled packer exception. |
| `2` | `apm.yml` schema validation error. |
| `3` | `--check-versions` failed: per-package versions disagree with the configured marketplace versioning strategy. |
| `4` | `--check-clean` failed: marketplace working tree is dirty (regenerated output differs from on-disk file), or remote Claude metadata could not be fetched to certify the comparison. |
| `5` | `--strict-metadata` failed: remote marketplace metadata was unavailable, so APM did not write the artifact. |
