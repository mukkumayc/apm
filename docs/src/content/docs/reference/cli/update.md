Refresh the dependencies declared in `apm.yml` to the latest matching versions or Git refs, after showing you the plan and asking for consent.

## Synopsis

```bash
apm update [OPTIONS] [PACKAGES...]
```

## Description

`apm update` re-resolves every dependency in your project's `apm.yml` against the newest version or Git ref allowed by its constraint, prints a structured plan -- **added**, **updated**, **removed**, **unchanged** -- and prompts before changing refs. Full-SHA revision pins are refreshed by resolving the latest annotated semver tag from the authoritative upstream, then rewriting the SHA in `apm.yml` with a tag annotation after you accept the plan (for example `# v2.0.0`). Decline the prompt and APM exits cleanly: no manifest rewrite, no lockfile write, no filesystem changes.

When every ref is already current but the locked `apm_modules/` cache is empty, `apm update` restores the cache from the same resolved refs without prompting. It uses the normal dependency materialization path without changing `apm.yml` or `apm.lock.yaml`. `--dry-run` remains read-only and does not restore files.

Pass one or more `PACKAGES` to refresh only those dependencies, or `-g/--global` to refresh the user-scope dependencies under `~/.apm/` instead of the current project. With these flags `apm update` is a strict superset of the deprecated [`apm deps update`](../deps/#apm-deps-update).

This is the dependency-refresh command. To upgrade the APM CLI binary itself, see [`apm self-update`](../self-update/).

:::note[Consent gate]
The interactive prompt for ref changes defaults to **No**. In non-interactive contexts (CI, piped stdin) you must pass `--yes` to apply ref changes. Restoring an empty cache from unchanged locked refs does not require consent.
:::

For a read-only install that pins to whatever is already in `apm.lock.yaml` -- the right command for CI -- use [`apm install --frozen`](../install/).

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `PACKAGES...` | Optional. One or more dependency names to refresh (short name like `compliance-rules` or canonical `owner/repo`). Omit to refresh everything. Unknown names exit non-zero with the available list. |

## Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--yes`, `-y` | off | Skip the interactive prompt and accept the plan. Required for non-interactive use. |
| `--dry-run` | off | Compute and print the plan without prompting and without writing the manifest, lockfile, or filesystem. |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | off | Show per-dependency resolution detail (old ref, new ref, source) and full error context. |
| `--global`, `-g` | off | Refresh user-scope dependencies under `~/.apm/` instead of the current project (mirrors `apm install -g`). |
| `--force` | off | Overwrite locally-authored files and deploy despite critical security findings. It does not change ref freshness: update still requires current upstream refs. Use only after independent verification. |
| `--parallel-downloads N` | `4` | Max concurrent package downloads. `0` disables parallelism. |
| `--target TARGET`, `-t TARGET` | resolution chain | Agent harness(es) to update for. Accepts the same target values and comma-separated lists as [`apm install --target`](../install/#target-selection). Resolution is `--target` > `apm.yml targets:` > `apm config set target ...` > auto-detect. |

## Examples

Preview what would change, without prompting or writing:

```bash
apm update --dry-run
```

Interactively review and accept the plan:

```bash
apm update
# prints plan, prompts: Apply these changes? [y/N]
```

Accept non-interactively (CI, scripts):

```bash
apm update --yes
```

Refresh only specific packages:

```bash
apm update org/pkg-a org/pkg-b
```

Refresh user-scope dependencies installed with `apm install -g`:

```bash
apm update -g
```

Decline the prompt -- nothing is written:

```bash
apm update
# Apply these changes? [y/N] n
# No changes applied.
```

## Behavior

- **Re-resolve every dep.** Each entry in `apm.yml` is resolved against its remote source for the newest version or ref allowed by the constraint (registry version, branch tip, latest matching tag, etc.). Full-SHA revision pins move only to the commit behind the latest annotated semver tag; branch refs and lightweight tags are refused. Local-path deps are skipped.
- **Mutable refs require upstream freshness.** APM resolves mutable Git refs through the authenticated upstream. If upstream resolution fails, the update fails instead of silently substituting a ref from the local bare Git cache. Content already cached for the freshly resolved SHA may still be reused.
- **Registry deps.** Registry semver deps are re-resolved against their configured registry. Deps already at the latest version satisfying their constraint appear as **unchanged** in the plan.
- **Structured plan.** Output is grouped into four sections:
  - **added** -- present in the new resolution but not in the previous lockfile.
  - **updated** -- ref or version moved.
  - **removed** -- previously locked, no longer required by `apm.yml`.
  - **unchanged** -- already at the latest matching version or ref.
- **Consent gate.** The prompt defaults to **No**. Without `--yes`, declining (or running in a non-interactive context) aborts with a clean exit; the manifest, lockfile, and workspace are untouched.
- **No partial consent.** A single prompt covers both revision-pin manifest rewrites and the normal update plan; declining leaves everything unchanged.
- **`--dry-run` skips the prompt.** It computes and prints the plan, including revision-pin SHA/tag rewrites, but never writes and never asks.
- **Target contraction is reconciled.** A successful update removes unchanged dependencies' deployed files, lockfile ownership, and merge-hook config/sidecar entries for targets no longer declared in `apm.yml`, even when no dependency ref changes -- same contract as [`apm install`'s target-contraction note](../install/#notes); see [Hooks and commands](../../../producer/author-primitives/hooks-and-commands/#hooks) for what the merge-hook config/sidecar files are.
- **One target decision covers services.** The effective target used for package deployment is reused for MCP and LSP reconciliation. Saved config targets are not re-detected or dropped after package updates. Required native config failures exit non-zero.
- **No-op and service-only repair.** An accepted update with no dependency ref changes still reconciles missing MCP/LSP config. A manifest with only MCP/LSP dependencies also uses `apm update` as a configuration repair pass; `--dry-run` previews this without writing.
- **Empty caches are restored.** If the lockfile expects dependencies but `apm_modules/` has no materialized packages, an otherwise unchanged update restores the cache from the same refs and reports `Restored dependency cache without changing refs.` No confirmation is required because dependency refs do not move.

### Missing annotated revision-pin tags

When a revision-pinned dependency has no eligible annotated tag, APM warns and
retains its current SHA while continuing with unrelated updates. Transport
failures and malformed or invalid remote SHAs still fail the update before
writes.

## Back-compat: `apm update` used to be the self-updater

In earlier releases, `apm update` self-updated the **APM CLI binary**. That behavior moved to [`apm self-update`](../self-update/) and `apm update` was repurposed as the dependency updater described above.

For one release after the rename, running `apm update` from a directory **without an `apm.yml`** prints a deprecation banner and forwards to `apm self-update` so existing muscle memory and scripts keep working. This shim is removed in the next minor release -- update your scripts to call `apm self-update` directly.
